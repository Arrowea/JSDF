OPERATION CANNON FODDER

OSMEAC

***Orientation 
We are currently in the middle of setting up a patrol base in a captured enemy military compound. 

The F.O.B. build by us has been made into an outpost and reinforced by allied forces.

***Situation:
(1) Size – Enemy squad, platoon… 
Unknown sizes. We have not received enough information about the enemy guerrilla forces in the area but we do know they have  AA/Artillery capabilities.
(2) Activity – Enemy digging in, bivouacking 
The enemy is regrouping and have been moving along MSR’s to dig in for a fight. Intel suggests that they have taken defensive positions around the AA/Artillery sites
(3) Location – Six-digit grid if possible 
Further information about this will be displayed on the mission map.
(4) Unit – Type and designation 
The New Leadership
(5) Time – When the enemy was last observed (6) Equipment – Equipment they possess 
Hidden away in AA/Artillery sites near the recent captured military base. Like last time they still use the same light/medium gear and equipment though there have been rumors of heavier reinforcements if our offense takes too long.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 b. DRAW-D - This acronym use to assist the leader in determining the enemy’s capabilities and limitations. 
(1) Defend- Enemy will defend AA/Arty sites in the AO 
(2) Reinforce- Enemy will reinforce if objectives are taken in a timely manner 
(3) Attack - enemy chance of attacking is low 
(4) Withdraw- the enemy is using typical guerrilla tactics and will pull out if out gunned. 
(5) Delay- the enemy is defending not probing any opposition 


*** (b) Mission - 
1. Who “ are we fighting”
A Guerilla force called The New Leadership which suddenly has appeared on Altis causing havoc. They are fed up with the current government and are trying to overthrow them to create a dictatorship. From what we know their leader is called Ajayi Brosseau, an partially unknown entrepreneur from France who was born in Altos. We are not completely sure if he actually is their leader or if he is the person this whole revolution is paid by. 

2. What “are we doing”
After last mission where JSDF has annexed  a enemy military base and have found documents suggesting about 6 enemy sites in the AO. These are points of interests are assigned  AA/Artillery sites.  Using all intel provided JSDF will need to investigate and destroy all points enemy assets to weaken its strength. 

3. When “will be synchronising or attack”
Situation dictated by Squad accomplishment, none at the moment. 

4. Where “ is the focal point of our attack/defense”
The focal point of friction will be to search and destroy the enemies AA/Artillery sites

5. Why “are we there in the first place”
JSDF was asked by the military of Altis to support them with taking down The New Leadership.

***(c) Execution - 
1. Concept of Operations - 
JSDF will be inserted via Helo at the landing zones placed by the Squad leads after doing a flyby of the area. During this flyby they will scout out suspicious activity and act accordingly. As mentioned in section D “Administration and Logistics”, they will not open fire on the enemy unless they are fired upon. Civilians were spotted in the area looting the bodies of the deceased fighters  in town of Pyrgos. Civilians have been spotted setting up refugee camps in the are as well, check fire.  After the AA/Artillery sites have been found, squads are tasked to take out all enemy equipment.
