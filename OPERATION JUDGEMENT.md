#### ***(B) Mission

After clearing some of the rubble of the towers we destroyed we have found more information which we can use to move on. The high ranking officer that fled when we took over the Military camp has been sighted in a town not too far away. For safety reasons the location of this officer will be kept strictly secret until our mission starts.
The designated area shows a high amount of civilian presence, some armed. However we must win the hearts and minds of the locals due to the instability of the region to keep our mission on track and not lose what allegiance we have with them 

2. What “are we doing”  
We are going to assault a secure location which, according to our intel, contains a high ranking officer which escaped us in the past. We are to capture him and return him to base.

3. When “will be synchronising or attack”  
Situation dictated by Squad accomplishment, none at the moment. 

4. Where “ is the focal point of our attack/defense”  
The focal point of friction will be to search and capture the high ranking officer.

5. Why “are we there in the first place”  
JSDF was asked by the military of Altis to support them with taking down The New Leadership.


#### ***(C) Execution

1. Concept of Operations -   
JSDF will either inserted via Helo or go via vehicles located at the designated area. They are to carefully pick a way of approach to the secret location and infiltrate it either loudly or stealthily. The way to approach will result in how the target will respond. Guns blazing may get him to flee fast while it takes less long. Going in stealthily may take longer but gives a higher chance of getting closer. The way this goes is all up to the squad leads and the actions of our soldiers. The time we attack is also decided by them. Once the high ranking officer is in our custody there is a chance the enemy rather sees him dead then alive. Keep him alive at all costs. 
Sidenote: If we do not get enough people for 1-3 we will get a recon group again.

2. Tasks - See coordinating Instructions

3. Coordinating Instructions - The specific instructions and tasks that apply to two or more units; includes order of movement, planned combat formations, tactical and fire control measures (i.e. phase lines and checkpoints) and any other tasks that pertain to the mission.
