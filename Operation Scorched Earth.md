After the strange death of some odd politician there has been a large scale search to who caused this. Turns out it was the Russians funding terrorists. We have found their headquarters in a location we have previously been near to. It is up to JSDF to go in and take out every living being in the area. It’s time for scorched earth. All citizens in the area have been notified and should be gone. If any civilians are still present, they are kill on sight.
