#### ***(B) Mission

JSDF has been tasked in joining a multi unit NATO operation to clear the Takistan Mountains of Russians Forces who have recently claimed the area. NATO has targeted several key areas for strategic bombing, but are unable to do so due to static AA positions. They have given the task of punching through the enemy lines and neutralizing these positions to JSDF. Other Nato units will draw enemy forces to the frontlines to keep them from breaking through on our flanks. Once the bombing run has been completed we are to go into the rubble and take out the remaining forces that survived.
