#### ***(B) Mission

Now that we have secured Death Camp and turned it into our new Outpost we have decided to take a break and get our bearings together. Although so we thought. We have picked up enemy radio frequencies talking about a group of organized attacks attack on our F.O.B. with the intent of complete destruction. We are not sure when they also intend to attack our position but the guard will remain on high alert. To counter this we have readied our helos with weapons to defend against this attack from the sky.The civilians in our custody that we rescued from the camp. We have to make sure they stay unharmed.   

2. What “are we doing”  
We are preparing to deflect a series of organized enemy attacks.  

3. When “will be synchronising or attack”  
Situation dictated by Squad accomplishment, none at the moment. This fully depends on communication between squads, HQ and the Outposts.  

4. Where “ is the focal point of our attack/defense”  
The focal point of friction will be to defend our F.O.B. and possible Outposts against enemy attacks.  

5. Why “are we there in the first place”  
JSDF was asked by the military of Altis to support them with taking down The New Leadership.


#### ***(C) Execution

1. Concept of Operations -   
JSDF will ready defenses to repel the enemy. All forces will be ordered to stay in the F.O.B. unless informed otherwise by HQ. The helos fitted with weaponry will only be used for defending the Outposts as losing those in the main battle at the F.O.B. will possibly cause us to lose one of our Outposts to the enemy. For this specific reason the Military has granted us the use of a Apache chopper (Limited uses).  

2. Tasks - See coordinating Instructions
