#### ***(B) Mission

We have been contracted by the Sahrani Army to escort a high ranking officer of theirs around the southern part of the island to three churches as a pilgrimage. This would be the church in Paraiso, Ortega and Cayo. The officer has informed us he will be requesting to stop at places he may also want to see on the way to which we have informed him that if things to too far and headquarters orders our troops to return to base he will comply. The main reason we have been hired to escort this officer is because the Liberation Army has gained more followers recently in these areas and bringing their own full army may cause an all out war. The HVT will arrive at our base boat and will not use any aircraft due to the fact that he is terrified of flying.
