#### ***(C) Execution

1. Concept of Operations -   
Both squads will get one vehicle with machine gun in which a driver and gunner will be placed. The rest of the squad will walk next to the vehicle once they arrive into the city and check for any strange things. Once intel comes in on where the whereabouts are of high ranking members all squads will mount up and tactically storm the new AO.  

2. Tasks - See coordinating Instructions

3. Coordinating Instructions - The specific instructions and tasks that apply to two or more units; includes order of movement, planned combat formations, tactical and fire control measures (i.e. phase lines and checkpoints) and any other tasks that pertain to the mission.  
1) Drive to the city.  
2) Leave the driver and gunner in the vehicle while walking next to the vehicle.  
3) Check your surrounding and report any suspicious behavior.  
4) Investigate said behavior if authorized.  
  
- HQ may radio that instructions will be changed, obey these  
- In case of emergency the vehicle will be used to retreat.  
- We don’t have more intel then given to HQ, we are no psychics.
