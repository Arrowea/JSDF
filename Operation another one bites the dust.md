#### ***(B) Mission

JSDF is tasked to search and destroy a Terrorist cell send out to either capture or kill a politician visiting the area, which of the two we do not know. We will escort the HVT to a rally point where he will have a meeting. During the trip to this location each vehicle should keep their eyes out for suspicious activity and explosives. After reaching the rally point we will defend the area and send out small groups to inspect suspicious locations and patrol the area. After all is settled we will escort the HVT back to the base and make sure he boards his chopper safely.  

2. What “are we doing”  
We are going to escort an HVT to a secure location while sending out small groups to investigate key points. With the death of the HVT our mission fails.  

3. When “will be synchronising or attack”  
Situation dictated by Squad accomplishment, none at the moment.   

4. Where “ is the focal point of our attack/defense”  
The focal point of this mission will be to escort the HVT and make sure he stays alive.  

5. Why “are we there in the first place”  
To make sure a political figure does not die. We get payed a lot for this mission.  


#### ***(C) Execution

1. Concept of Operations -   
JSDF will either inserted via Helo or go via vehicles located at the designated area. They are to carefully pick a way of approach to the secret location and infiltrate it either loudly or stealthily. The way to approach will result in how the target will respond. Guns blazing may get him to flee fast while it takes less long. Going in stealthily may take longer but gives a higher chance of getting closer. The way this goes is all up to the squad leads and the actions of our soldiers. The time we attack is also decided by them. Once the high ranking officer is in our custody there is a chance the enemy rather sees him dead then alive. Keep him alive at all costs. 
Sidenote: If we do not get enough people for 1-3 we will get a recon group again.

2. Tasks - See coordinating Instructions
