#### ***(B) Mission

After the defense against enemy attacks on our main F.O.B. and outposts we have located the enemies main bases of operation. We are tasked to steal a plane from the airport which is in enemy hands and used to travel goods away from Altis to their now many outposts around the globe. JSDF will use this plane to paradrop at the enemy location and stop their actions on Altis for good.  

2. What “are we doing”  
We are going to assault a secure location via paradrop and take out the main enemy base of operations.  

3. When “will be synchronising or attack”  
Situation dictated by Squad accomplishment, none at the moment. 

4. Where “ is the focal point of our attack/defense”  
The focal point of this mission will be to eradicate the T.N.L. of Altis.  

5. Why “are we there in the first place”  
JSDF will use the vehicles we have to reach the airport to seize a plane big enough to carry out paradrop in waves into the enemy compounds. How this will be done shall be coordinated by squad leads.   


#### ***(C) Execution

1. Concept of Operations -   
JSDF will either inserted via Helo or go via vehicles located at the designated area. They are to carefully pick a way of approach to the secret location and infiltrate it either loudly or stealthily. The way to approach will result in how the target will respond. Guns blazing may get him to flee fast while it takes less long. Going in stealthily may take longer but gives a higher chance of getting closer. The way this goes is all up to the squad leads and the actions of our soldiers. The time we attack is also decided by them. Once the high ranking officer is in our custody there is a chance the enemy rather sees him dead then alive. Keep him alive at all costs. 
Sidenote: If we do not get enough people for 1-3 we will get a recon group again.

2. Tasks - See coordinating Instructions

3. Coordinating Instructions - The specific instructions and tasks that apply to two or more units; includes order of movement, planned combat formations, tactical and fire control measures (i.e. phase lines and checkpoints) and any other tasks that pertain to the mission.

3) Take out the T.N.L. main bases of Altis.
