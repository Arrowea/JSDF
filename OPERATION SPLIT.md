#### ***(B) Mission

After capturing and questioning the POW on pernant information on the enemy's future operations it was made aware that  that another high ranking officer will be visiting close by. The POW also informed us that a nearby town Anthrakia has been rounded up and send to a death camp and are awaiting execution, for sympathising with us. This all comes with a catch. The time events of the officer visiting the AO and the scheduled execution will be in and around the same time (Around Sunset). HQ/SL will need to make critical decisions about how to approach this situation.  

2. What “are we doing”  
We are going to either a death camp in order to save allied civilians or we will attack a location which is visited by an enemy Lieutenant and capture him.

3. When “will be synchronising or attack”  
Situation dictated by Squad accomplishment, none at the moment. Depends on  mission.

4. Where “ is the focal point of our attack/defense”  
The focal point of friction will be to search and capture the high ranking officer.

5. Why “are we there in the first place”  
JSDF was asked by the military of Altis to support them with taking down The New Leadership.


#### ***(C) Execution

1. Concept of Operations -   
JSDF will either inserted via Helo or go via vehicles located to go to the designated AO and scout out possible weaknesses before attempting a full scale assault. At this moment all intel surrounding these missions will not be given out yet.   
Sidenote: If we do not get enough people for 1-3 we will get a recon group again.

2. Tasks - See coordinating Instructions

3. Coordinating Instructions - The specific instructions and tasks that apply to two or more units; includes order of movement, planned combat formations, tactical and fire control measures (i.e. phase lines and checkpoints) and any other tasks that pertain to the mission.  
 1) Scout out the marked AO.  
 2) Approach the AO in the ordered way.  
 3) Locate the target(s).  
   4a. Capture the enemy Lieutenant and escort him to the F.O.B.
