#### ***(B) Mission

After our failure last mission in which we let our HVT die due to a friendly artillery strike we have gained no new intel on any of the enemies advances. The civilians we could have rescued are all killed but the Death Camp is still active. We will go there at once and take out the camp to avoid any future harm to more of the surrounding towns. Due to our previous failure we have been declined any off map artillery though we have something else to compensate.

We are going to the Death Camp in order to save allied civilians.  

3. When “will be synchronising or attack”  
Situation dictated by Squad accomplishment, none at the moment. 

4. Where “ is the focal point of our attack/defense”  
The focal point of friction will be to search and capture the high ranking officer.

5. Why “are we there in the first place”  
JSDF was asked by the military of Altis to support them with taking down The New Leadership.


#### ***(C) Execution

1. Concept of Operations -   
JSDF will either inserted via Helo or go via vehicles located to go to the designated AO and scout out possible weaknesses before attempting a full scale assault. They are to take down every enemy they can find and rescue anyone who still is captured. The mission will be successful if the Death Camp is fully taken out which after it will become our next Outpost.  
Sidenote: If we do not get enough people for 1-3 we will get a recon group again.
